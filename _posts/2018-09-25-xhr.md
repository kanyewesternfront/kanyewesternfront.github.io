### What is the XMLHttpRequest?

Maybe you want to see some cat gifs, so you go to imgur.com. Right then your computer requests to access Imgur's homepage. Imgur's server responds, and allows you access. Then you go to the search bar and enter "cat.gif" and hit enter. Once again your browser sends a request to Imgur's server asking for all the cat gifs, and Imgur responds with cat gifs.

![]({{ site.github.url }}/assets/img/photos/XHR.jpg)

This request and response is called XMLHttpRequest, and it is the conversation that happens between browsers and servers every time we access the World Wide Web.

### Methods

There are different types of conversations that occur between browsers and servers, called methods.

The most common type is the `GET` method, which is used for "getting" or retrieving information from the resource. It is the most benign of all conversations, as it is the interaction your browser had with Imgur's server when you asked for cat gifs. You ask and they provide.

Another common one is the `POST` method, which is used for creating or "posting," new information to the resource. If you want to upload your own cat gifs to Imgur, you would create an account. Adding your information to Imgur's server's resource uses the `POST` method. The same thing happens when you add that gif of your cat knocking something into the bathtub.

`PUT` updates information, and `DELETE` deletes it. Of course you can't just try and delete information you have no business deleting. Imgur's servers won't let you delete rival cat gifs because you don't have permission to do so.  

### Status Codes

Status codes indicate the status of the response the client gets from the server. The two most common are 200 and 404.

  * `200 OK`
  This means the request was successful and whatever the client requested was found.    
  * `404 Not Found`
  Everyone has seen this page before. A link to a page that doesn't exist. How existential.
  But it means the server couldn't find what the client requested. That one cat gif you knew was there...isn't.
