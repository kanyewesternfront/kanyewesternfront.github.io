### What is the XMLHttpRequest?

We all browse the web in a state of blissful ignorance. You don't have to dial up anymore, you don't have to wait for sites to load. If a site is down, you can find another site where thousands of others have already started screeching about it, so you know its not you.

But regardless of whether or not you think about it, something is happening each time you open Chrome and enter a website into the address search bar.

For example, maybe you want to see some cat gifs so you type imgur.com into your address bar and press enter. That is an event. Kinda philosophical, right? Then your computer sends a request to Imgur's server to access their homepage. The server responds, giving you access.

![]({{ site.github.url }}/assets/img/photos/XHR.jpg)

You go to the search bar and enter "cat.gif" and hit enter. Once again your browser sends a request to Imgur's server asking for moar cat gifs, and Imgur responds with all the cat gifs it has.

This request and response is called XMLHttpRequest, and it is the conversation that happens between your browser or computer (the client) and a website's server every time we access the World Wide Web.

### Methods

Like in life, not all conversations are the same. The different types of conversations that occur between browsers and servers are called methods.

The most common type is the `GET` method, which is used for "getting" or retrieving information from the resource. It is the most benign of all conversations, as it is the interaction your browser had with Imgur's server when you asked for cat gifs. You ask and they provide.

Another common one is the `POST` method, which is used for creating or "posting," new information to the resource. If you want to upload your own cat gifs to Imgur, you would create an account. Adding your information to Imgur's server's resource uses the `POST` method. The same thing happens when you add that gif of your cat knocking something into the bathtub.

`PUT` updates information, and `DELETE` deletes it. Of course you can't just try and delete information you have no business deleting. Imgur's servers won't let you delete rival cat gifs because you don't have permission to do so.  

### Status Codes

Status codes indicate the status of the response the client gets from the server. The two most common are 200 and 404.

  * `200 OK`
  This means the request was successful and whatever the client requested was found.    
  * `404 Not Found`
  Everyone has seen this page before. A link to a page that doesn't exist. How existential.
  But it means the server couldn't find what the client requested. That one cat gif you knew was there...isn't.
