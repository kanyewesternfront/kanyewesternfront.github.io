But it doesn't provide everything for everybody, and there are disadvantages. It doesn't update in realtime, nor can it be updated from anywhere on any device, unlike blog-hosting sites like WordPress, which can be updated on a smartphone via the User Interface (UI). So what type of site you use depends on your needs. Static sites are good for blogs or maintaining content that isn't always changing, and that have a minimum of users.

Jekyll's [website](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/) has a good tutorial for how to install the components you need to install Jekyll including Ruby and Ruby Gems. If you have a Mac, which is what I use, Ruby should already be installed.

When I first started using the commands to install the Ruby Gems Bundler, I ran into a common problem where my terminal said something along the lines of "You do not have write permissions..." and wouldn't allow me to install the bundler. The solution to this problem is to run sudo along with your installation of bundler, like this:

It will ask for your Mac login password. The first time usually doesn't work, so it prompts you a second time. Just enter your password again. It should install at this point.
